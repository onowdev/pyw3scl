Set
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data,
the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

* Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.
Sets are written with curly brackets {}.
Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
